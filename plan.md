Below is the detailed plan for developing the Sirajgong Sadar All Service App. This plan outlines every dependent file, change, and integration point with error handling and best practices in mind.

---

**1. Project Structure & File Changes**

- **src/app/layout.tsx**  
  - Create a new layout file that wraps every page.  
  - Implement a responsive navbar with links to “Home,” “Citizen Services,” “Payment Services,” “Complaints,” “Emergency Services,” and “Service Tracking.”  
  - Use Tailwind CSS classes for spacing, typography, and color without external icon libraries.  
  - Add error fallback UI (e.g., a simple alert banner) if critical layout components fail to load.

- **src/app/page.tsx (Landing Page)**  
  - Develop a modern landing page that introduces the service app.  
  - Include a hero banner using a placeholder `<img>` tag with the following attributes:  
    - src = "https://placehold.co/1200x800?text=Modern+hero+banner+with+clean+typography+and+responsive+layout"  
    - alt = "Modern hero banner displaying clean typography, ample spacing, and responsive design layout"  
    - An `onerror` handler to hide the image if it fails to load.  
  - Display a brief overview of available services in a card grid pattern (reuse the UI card component from src/components/ui/card.tsx).

- **Service Pages (Under src/app)**  
  - **Citizen Services – src/app/services/page.tsx**  
    - List various services (e.g., Birth Certificate, Death Certificate, Trade License) using card-style layouts.  
    - Include a button labeled “Apply Now” that routes to a dynamic service detail page.  
  - **Service Detail – src/app/services/[serviceId]/page.tsx**  
    - Implement dynamic routing for each service using Next.js parameters.  
    - Display an application form built with react-hook-form.  
    - Use Zod for client- and server-side validation; show error messages using the alert UI (src/components/ui/alert.tsx).  
  - **Payment Services – src/app/payment/page.tsx**  
    - Create a form for billing and account details.  
    - Simulate payment processing by calling a new API endpoint.  
    - Use try/catch in both form submission and API logic to handle errors and display user-friendly messages.
  - **Complaints/Feedback – src/app/complaints/page.tsx**  
    - Develop a form for users to log grievances with input fields and proper validation.  
    - On submission, call an API route that returns either success or an error response.
  - **Emergency Services – src/app/emergency/page.tsx**  
    - Display a list of static emergency contact numbers styled in modern cards.  
    - Use textual emphasis and spacing for a clean presentation.
  - **Service Tracking – src/app/tracking/page.tsx**  
    - Provide an input field where users can enter an application ID.  
    - Call a simulated API endpoint to return the tracking status (render a progress bar using src/components/ui/progress.tsx).

- **API Endpoints (Under src/app/api)**  
  - **Service Submission – src/app/api/serviceSubmission/route.ts**  
    - Create a POST API endpoint that accepts service application data.  
    - Validate input using Zod; use try/catch to capture any errors and return appropriate JSON error responses.
  - **Payment Simulation – src/app/api/payment/route.ts**  
    - Implement an endpoint to simulate payment processing.  
    - Handle errors or failed transactions gracefully and return detailed error messages.
  - **Complaint Registration – src/app/api/complaints/route.ts**  
    - Build an endpoint for accepting complaint data with validation and error handling.

- **Globals and Styling (src/app/globals.css)**  
  - Update globals.css with a modern, mobile-first design theme.  
  - Define base typography, responsive breakpoints, and spacing guidelines.  
  - Ensure consistency across all pages for a unified look and feel.

**2. UI/UX and Best Practices**

- Use Tailwind CSS for clean, modern interfaces. Ensure all UI components use proper spacing, font sizing, and responsive breakpoints.
- Do not include external icon libraries or images from services like Pexels/Unsplash. Instead, use descriptive placeholder images when needed.
- Error messages and loading states are handled both in components (using toast/alert components) and in API routes with try/catch blocks.
- Validate all form input both client- and server-side using react-hook-form and Zod.
- All file changes follow single-responsibility and modular design patterns with clear TypeScript type annotations.

---

**3. Integration & Testing**

- Update README.md with run instructions and API endpoint documentation.
- Test each API endpoint using curl:
  - Example for the service submission endpoint:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/serviceSubmission \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"service": "birthCertificate", "name": "John Doe"}'
    ```
- Ensure graceful degradation: On API failures or lazy loading failures (images), render fallback UI.

---

**Summary:**  
- Establish a base layout (src/app/layout.tsx) with a responsive navbar and error fallback.  
- Build a landing page (src/app/page.tsx) featuring a hero banner with a descriptive placeholder image.  
- Develop dedicated pages for Citizen Services, Payment, Complaints, Emergency, and Service Tracking using Next.js dynamic routing.  
- Implement robust form handling and validation using react-hook-form and Zod.  
- Create API endpoints for service submission, payment, and complaint registration with comprehensive error handling.  
- Update globals.css with modern typography and responsive designs using Tailwind CSS.  
- Integrate consistent UI components from src/components/ui while avoiding external icon libraries and images.  
- Validate each feature with curl tests to ensure proper API responses and error handling.  
- Document usage and steps in the README.md to aid future developers and users.
